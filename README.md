# rubber-ducky-brute-forcer-script-maker
It makes rubber ducky scripts to brute force passwords.


Just put the passwords you want to try in the passwords.txt file and run the program.
The program will ask for a delay and whether or not to press enter after each password.
Then it will make the code in the code.txt file.

Only use on your own devices.
